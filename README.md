# Detecting-cardiac-abnormality

In recent years, there has been a growing use of computers to detect cardiac diseases. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used to diagnose heart conditions. Given the high mortality rate associated with cardiac diseases, detecting abnormal ECG signals is crucial. In this exercise, we aim to identify ECG abnormalities by treating the ECG signals as functional data, extracting relevant features, and applying a classification method to distinguish between normal and abnormal ECGs. We use Random Forest (RF) as the classification method.
